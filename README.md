This repository contains the code used for the analysis of SQM data on washetdonker.nl in the Keep it Dark Project. The files are Jupyter Notebooks, and at a minimum, you’ll need Python and Jupyter installed to run them. Additional Python modules may be required depending on the specific notebook—check the imports and install as needed (e.g., with pip).
